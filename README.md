Ransomware
-------------
1. One Kind of malware
2. Blocked/restricted user to enter his/her machine
3. Encrypted all files from hard disk

Royal ransoware
------------------
1. Encrypts files and appends the .royal extension to filname.
      .jpg.royal    .exe.royal
2.Ransom note state that victims cannot access their files bcz they are encrypted.

3. It is rarely possible to decrypt files encrypted by the ransomware without paying them a ransom.
4. Free data recovery is impossible unless victims have a data backup or a workingthird-party decryption tools.
5. Common diff between ransomware attacks are the prices of decryption tools and algorithm used to encrypt files.
6. Ransomware is distributed via fake installer for pirated/cracked software

Vmware Vsphere
----------------
Developed by VMware, vSphere is a cloud computing virtualization platform.
vSphere is a suite of virtualization solutions that includes vCenter, ESXi, vRealized Operations, and more
The core ability of vSphere is the centralized management of your virtual machines and virtual environment.

Functionality of Vsphere:

   Easily creates and manages multiple virtual machines
   Migrates workloads and data center maintenance live and avoid downtime
   Manages offices remotely
   Creates a flexible environment customized to your organization’s specific needs and requirements

Benefits of Vsphere: 

   Improved security and protection of valuable data
   Reduced IT hardware costs

Vcenter Server
---------------------
vCenter is a component of VMware’s vSphere. It is designed to offer advanced server management 
capabilities through a centralized platform.

 Function:
 1. Runs up to 2,000 hosts and 35,000 virtual machines using a single instance
 2. Solves problems faster with customizable trigger
 3. Full scalability across hybrid cloud environments

Vmware ESXi
--------------
VMware ESXi is yet another component of vSphere. It is also one of the most popular components because it delivers the core virtualization 
services organizations need. It is a bare-metal hypervisor:bare metal hypervisor is the most commonly deployed 
type of hypervisor. This is where the virtualization software is installed directly on the hardware

-->When a hypervisor is installed directly on the hardware of a physical machine, 
   between the hardware and the operating system (OS), it is called a bare metal hypervisor.

Hypervisor: A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, 
            is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).

Vmware ESXi :This type of hypervisor installs directly onto a physical machine and creates the 
             separation necessary to divide it into one or more virtual machines. 

Function : Reducing hardware resources and improving efficiency
           Reduces the IT footprint

vCenter vs. ESXi
--------------------------
ESXi and vCenter are two different components of vSphere. vCenter is advanced server management software 
usually deployed as a pre-configured Linux virtual machine, while ESXi is a virtualized hypervisor 
that is installed only on physical machines. These are both part of the vSphere solution.
