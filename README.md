Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Face Recognition Door Unlock Project: 

Introduction:
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and detailed description of the Face Recognition Door Unlock Project. The project is aimed at developing a secure and user-friendly door unlock system that utilizes face recognition technology. The system will allow users to unlock the door using their face as the key.

System Requirements:
1. Hardware: a. Arduino Uno microcontroller b. Servo Motor c. Web camera
2. Software: a. Python programming language b. OpenCV library c. PySerial library d. Pyttsx3 library e. Numpy library

Functional Requirements:
1. Face detection: The system should be able to detect a face in real-time and compare it with the registered faces stored in the database.
2. Face recognition: The system should be able to recognize the face and match it with the registered faces in the database.
3. Unlock mechanism: Upon successful recognition of the face, the system should trigger the servo motor to unlock the door.
4. User interface: The system should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to register their faces and manage the registered faces in the database.
5. Voice prompt: The system should provide audio feedback to the users through a voice prompt.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Accuracy: The system should have a high accuracy rate in detecting and recognizing faces.
2. Real-time performance: The system should have a fast processing time and should provide real-time results.
3. User experience: The system should provide a smooth and convenient user experience.

Project Plan:
1. Requirements gathering and analysis: The project team will gather and analyze the system requirements for the project.
2. Design and development: The project team will design and develop the system, including the hardware setup and the software implementation.
3. Testing: The project team will perform thorough testing of the system to ensure that it meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
4. Deployment: The project team will deploy the system and provide training and support to the end-users.
5. Maintenance: The project team will provide ongoing maintenance and support to ensure the smooth operation of the system.

Conclusion:
The Face Recognition Door Unlock Project is a secure and user-friendly door unlock system that utilizes face recognition technology. The system provides a convenient and secure way for users to unlock the door using their face.
